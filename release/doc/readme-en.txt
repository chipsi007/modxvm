2. INSTALL
-----------------------------------------------------------

  1. Unzip archive to game folder:
     Right click to archive -> "Extract all..." -> select game folder -> "Extract"

  2. You do not need to setup anything by default.

    If you want special settings, you need to rename boot config file:
      \res_mods\xvm\configs\xvm.xc.sample to xvm.xc
    Instructions for setting it up are inside.

    All possible config options you can see in
      \res_mods\xvm\configs\@Default\

    Note: If you want to change the config manually, use Notepad, DO NOT use MS Word,
    WordPad and such editors.

  3. If XVM incorrectly detects the language of the game client,
    then in the configuration file (by default \res_mods\xvm\configs\@default\@xvm.xc)
    change the value of the variable "language" from "auto" to the language code.
    The language code must match the name of the file in the \res_mods\xvm\l10n\ (for example, "en").

  4. There is possibility to install nightly builds of XVM.
    You can download nightly builds on http://nightly.modxvm.com/

    Localization macros usage - {{l10n:localizationKey}}
      Macros are just links to translations in file res_mods/xvm/l10n/XX.xc file (XX means language code).
      If the translation is not found, "localizationKey" is displayed.

      Capture bar example
        /l10n/en.xc
          "enemyBaseCaptured": "Base captured by allies!"
        captureBar.xc
          "captureDoneFormat":    "<font size='17' color='#FFCC66'>{{l10n:enemyBaseCaptured}}</font>"

        formated: "<font size='17' color='#FFCC66'>Base captured by allies!</font>"

      More about localization at wiki: https://code.google.com/p/wot-xvm/wiki/LocalizingXVM

  "format" field examples:
    1. Show number of kilo-battles, efficiency and GWR without changing a color:
      "{{kb}} {{xwn8}} {{rating}}"
    2. The same, but with each number colored by its value:
      "<font color='{{c:kb}}'>{{kb}}</font> <font color='{{c:xwn8}}'>{{xwn8}}</font> <font color='{{c:rating}}'>{{rating}}</font>"
    3. Same as 2, but with aligned columns:
      "<font face='Consolas' size='11'><font color='{{c:kb}}'>{{kb:3}}</font> <font color='{{c:xwn8}}'>{{xwn8}}</font> <font color='{{c:rating}}'>{{rating:3}}</font></font>"
    4. Show GWR colored by xwn:
      "<font color='{{c:xwn8}}'>{{rating}}</font>"

  Dynamic color and transparency usage examples:
    "color": "{{c:xwn8}}" - color depending on xwn
    "alpha": "{{a:hp}}" - transparency depending on current health

  Clan and players icons.
  Config parameter battle/clanIconsFolder set path to clan icons root folder.

  All icons are loading automatically from game region subfolder (RU/EU/US/... or
  ID for player's account id).

  To add your clan or player icon, just copy icon file to:
    \res_mods\xvm\res\clanicons\[REGION]\clan\ (for clan)
    \res_mods\xvm\res\clanicons\[REGION]\nick\ (for single player)
    \res_mods\xvm\res\clanicons\ID\ (for single player by accountId)
  Also you can create default clan and player icons:
    \res_mods\xvm\res\clanicons\[REGION]\clan\default.png (for default clan)
    \res_mods\xvm\res\clanicons\[REGION]\nick\default.png (for default player)
  Search order is:
    ID/<accountId>.png -> nick/<playerName>.png -> clan/<clan>.png -> clan/default.png -> nick/default.png
  TOP 150 clans are added to mod archive by default.
  Full archive with all clans can be downloaded separately:
    http://www.modxvm.com/en/download-xvm/
    Files: clanicons-full-RU-XXX.zip (RU), clanicons-full-EU-XXX.zip (EU), clanicons-full-NA-XXX.zip (NA),
    clanicons-full-ASIA-XXX.zip (ASIA), clanicons-full-KR-XXX.zip (KR)

  6-th sense image.
  To change sixth sense indicator place alternative PNG image to
   \res_mods\xvm\res\SixthSense.png.

  Hit Log.
  Negative x, y values allow to bind the text to the right and bottom edges for
  the same behavior with different screen resolutions.

  Clock in battle and in battle loading screen.
  Format: PHP Date: http://php.net/date
  For example:
      "clockFormat": "H:i"          => 01:23
      "clockFormat": "Y.m.d H:i:s"  => 2013.05.20 01:23:45
